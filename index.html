    <p class="me">Hi. Im Ryan Holt and I am currently in web development bootcamp at the University of Minnesota!
        There are a lot of things that I love other than website development and computer coding!</p>
    <p>I love being outside and active! I play Division 2 paintball for team Vintageâ„¢! Now I know it sounds like just a bunch of kids running 
        around in their backyard in the woods shooting each other but I promise you it is very far from that! Theres quite a few tournament series in competetive paintball, 
        vintage even has their own, vps (Vintage Paintball Series)! The most well known tournament series is called NXL, or National X-ball League. Divisions start from d5 (begginer) to d4, d3, d2, SP, then Pro.
        Points are made on a website called APPA which bases the points off of the events you play and what you place. Its a lot of fun and we travel to 5 different locations to play these NXL tournaments.
        The NXL venues that we travel too are:
        <ul>
            <li>Las Vegas, Nevada.</li>
            <li>Dallas, Texas.</li>
            <li>Philadelphia, Pensylvania.</li>
            <li>Chicago, Illinios.</li>
            <li>Kissimmee, Florida.</li>
        </ul>
       <p> They also have venues in Europe, and Mexico.</p>
    </p>
    <p> Theres a lot I love doing besides just paintball! I love hammocking, kayaking, working out, and just being outside or just active in general!
        I was born in Florida so I grew up being on the beach and in the ocean all the time! My father, brother and I all used to do a lot of
        snorkeling and scuba diving aswell!</p>
